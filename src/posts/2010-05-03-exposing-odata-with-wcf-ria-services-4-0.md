I was just about to write up a little blog on the how and why of Exposing OData (Open Data Protocol) in WCF 4.0.  
But seeming it being a Bank Holiday and, if you follow any of my posts, you'll know I don't spend a lot of time writing them up, they are more like mini blogs ![Laughing](/blog/editors/tiny_mce3/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-laughing.gif)

So I found this excellent article by Brad Abrams

I recommend you have a read because if you've never encounted OData before you'll be amazed how easy it is to expose and consume your domain service (expecially with Excel 2010)
