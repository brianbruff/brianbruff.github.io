I’ve been quite vocal in the past that the Java language syntax is low on my list of favourite languages. I believe this stems from the fact that I write lots of C# (and even Typescript) these days, and those languages are a lot nicer to work with. 

Lately I invested a little time in other languages, Go and Kotlin for the JVM. 

While I’m yet to formulate my view on GoLang I absolutely fell in love with Kotlin from jetbrains; if you work on the JVM I encourage you to check it out, It is simply awesome!
