Adding project dependencies on Visual studio is done automatically with .NET projects when Add Reference dialog chooses another project from your solution.

However you can get Visual Studio to add project dependencies if no explicit intra project reference exists.

Right click on your solution, choose properties and choose the project dependencies option.
