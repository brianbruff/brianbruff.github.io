Take some time to explore the new vs2010 debugger.

Those of you to have experience with multithreading know that it can be a right old PIA (and i'm not talking Primary interop assembly here!).

Try the parallel tasks/stacks in vs2010 and see just how valuable a friend they become :-)

In recent times, CPU clock speeds have stagnated and manufacturers have shifted their focus to increasing core counts.  
This is problematic for us as programmers because our standard single-threaded code will not automatically run faster as a result of those extra cores.

Spend some time investigating the new Tasks in .net 4.0
