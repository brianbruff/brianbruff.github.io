After all these years, where I’ve modified connections strings etc in the web.config release folder.  
I’ve finally realised I can preview the transformation that Visual Studio Does. To be really honest I’m not sure if this is a new feature of VS2012 or if it always existed, but it’s fantastic, give it a go if like me you’ve been living in the dark ages.
