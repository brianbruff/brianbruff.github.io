The pDc has local scope and is of type CPaintDC\*.

Now don’t be confused with the other place you may have used auto, i.e. back in the early days when we used to be concerned about putting things in registers (before the compilers took over this code generation heavy lifting).  
e.g. auto int i = 0;
