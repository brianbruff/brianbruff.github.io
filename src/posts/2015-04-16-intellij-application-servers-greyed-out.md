If you ever come across the problem of the IntelliJ Application Servers menu greyed out like this:

![](/images//images/image_thumb_365.png)

This is simply because you need at least one Run Configuration.

I’m using JBoss just now so here’s what I do to add a run config:

![](/images//images/image_thumb_366.png)

![](/images//images/image_thumb_367.png)

![](/images//images/image_thumb_368.png)

Once this is done you can now see your application servers tools window menu item becomes enabled.
