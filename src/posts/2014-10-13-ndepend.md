Hi all, I’d like to introduce you to what appears to be a great tool for the .net platform. <http://www.ndepend.com/>

I’ve promised to write a review on this tool, however, I’ll be perfectly honest and admit, that I’ve just not got the time right now, so I’m going to take a short cut.

### Podcasts

I listen to a lot of podcasts mostly when driving or cycling, recently I’ve started listening to a new podcast <http://www.codingblocks.net/> it’s a good podcast and I hope it continues to stick around. As it turns out this podcast did a review on NDepends <http://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/ndepend-on-how-good-your-code-is/> and I encourage you to check it out. Moreover; in a more recent episode they mention that they’ve received feedback from Patrick Smacchia (Lead Developer and brains behind the tool) and the feedback they’ve received from Patrick on the few little niggles they encountered is quite positive and upbeat.

When I find myself looking for some tooling like this I’ll write a proper review of my own, but until then based on my interactions with Patrick and after listening to the podcast above, I encourage you, that if you’re in the market for such analysis tools to take [**NDepends**](http://www.ndepend.com/) for a spin, and let us know how you get on!
