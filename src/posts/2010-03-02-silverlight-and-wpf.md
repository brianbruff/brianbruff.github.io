Tonight I tried to use the FlowDocument that you'll know well if you are familiar with WPF....

Important part above "tried to use" .... but ... silverlight version 3 doesn't support it :-(

Thats a second thing I've found lacking as I move some code to Silverlight, i've also found that DataTriggers don't work like the do in WPF ![Cry](/blog/editors/tiny_mce3/plugins/emotions/img/smiley-cry.gif)
