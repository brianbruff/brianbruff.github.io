Ok, only you can decide if this is something you want to do, keeping in mind the security concerns.

**Here’s how:**

  * Press the Windows key + R on your keyboard to launch the “Run” dialog box. 
  * Type in **control userpasswords2** \+ ENTER
  * The User Accounts window will display.

  * Uncheck “Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer”
  * Click OK
  * You will then be prompted to enter the current password and confirm it. 
  * After doing so, you will no longer be prompted to enter your password upon login.
