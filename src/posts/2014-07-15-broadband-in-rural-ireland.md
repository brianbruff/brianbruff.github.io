This is a post, that I've just not got time to explain in full yet... 

But if you are stuck on 1-2mbps ADSL and have a bit of time on your hands then its possible to get +20mbps broadband.

I achieved this by load balancing a fixed wireless connection of 8mbps with a HSPDA 12+mbps connection. The HSPDA connection took most of the work and involved installing a fixed external yagi antenna for starters..

So far so good! PM me for more details.
