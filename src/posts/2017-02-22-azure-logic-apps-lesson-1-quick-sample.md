Hi all, I’ve been pretty busy lately and have been struggling to get the time to write a few blog posts. So what I’ve decided to try do is create a few videos instead, I’m going for a warts and all approach so I’m not editing the videos before publishing, this will allow you to get a better feel for what is involved in working with Azure rather than looking at a well polished demo that leave some critical parts uncovered (that’s my excuse for not making time to try edit it!)

## Lesson 1

A quick sample to get a feel for Logic Apps.
