If like me you prefer to learn keyboard shortcuts and sell your soul in order to avoid moving the mouse, then you’ll like these shortcuts that I’ve stumbled upon this evening.

  * **Win]+[Left Arrow]** : Dock the active window to the left of the screen 
  * [**Win]+[Right Arrow]** : Dock the active window to the right of the screen 
  * **[Win]+[Up Arrow]** : Maximize the active window 
  * **[Win]+[Down Arrow]** : Restore from the Maximized Position, or Minimize as an active window 

And for the multi monitor people out there………

### **[Win]+[Shift} +[Right or Left Arrow]** : Move the active window from once screen to the other
