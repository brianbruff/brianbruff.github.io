_I usually try avoid getting into the OS / Browser etc drama, yawn….  
_  
But I found [this blog post](http://blog.pluralsight.com/2012/05/31/if-windows-8-is-too-radical-for-your-desktop-which-os-would-you-switch-to/) on Pluralsite tonight, and I can help but laugh, I’m with the 72% it turns out, I am asking myself did I pick that option because it was just funny however ![Smile](./image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-smile_14.png)

## A little drama

> **Q:** Will I use Windows8? **A:** Yes I’ve been using it since developer preview.  
> **Q:** Am I bothered? **A:** Not really, it’s a new opportunity so I’m getting on board.  
> **Q:** Would I like the option to switch off Metro? **A:** Hell ya! (but I’m then back in Win7 ain’t I? maybe I sub consciously picked the correct answer).
