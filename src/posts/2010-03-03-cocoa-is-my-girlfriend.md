Tonight I've stumbled across an interesting Blog on cimgf.

It's been many years since I wrote PHP, so I'd naturally use asp.net serverside (or if i had a pc powerfull enough I'd use the new REST capabilities of Sharepoint 2010 server).

I've been dying to have a play with Azures for sometime now but I'm always either snowed under with work or playing with some other technology, I remember reading that Azures (storage at least) has a REST API, and with the launch of the iPhone on the Vodafone network at the end of this month I've been looking into what's involved in writing objective C (and some mono stuff) so it seems I may finally get to have a play :-)
