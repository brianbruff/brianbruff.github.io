So does your browser support the html5 audio tag when it comes to MP3s?

Browsers in order of my preference

### IE9 – Nope

### Firefox 5 – Nope, Moreover doesn't gracefully degrade to my fallback text!

### Chrome 13 – Sure

### Safari 5 – Arguably the best default experience

[Try for your self and let me know how you get on](/html5/Audio.html) (excuse the lack of the DOCTYPE, encoding etc.

It’s quote a catchy song, you’ll miss out if your browser doesn’t support it (or you are not familiar with view source ![Smile](/blog/image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-smile_8.png) )
