In computing, a **materialized view** is a database object that contains the results of a query. For example, it may be a local copy of data located remotely, or may be a subset of the rows and/or columns of a table or join result, or may be a summary using an aggregate function.

However when dealing with microservices that have well defined domain boundaries and own their own datasets the
