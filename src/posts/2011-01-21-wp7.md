Received my first windows phone today, just had to try an app after finishing work..  
Wrote a little app to search the subnet looking for some jboss application servers, works just as well on my phone connected to wifi ![Rolling on the floor laughing](/blog/image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-rollingonthefloorlaughing_1.png)

Pretty chuffed with myself, the effort over the last number of years learning xaml has really paid off..

it’s helped in

- WF4 Activity designers
- WPF application
- Silverlight web  
  And now…. Mobile phone apps
