I’ve been playing (seriously playing) with Visual Studio LightSwitch for the last few weeks and I have to say it’s knocking my socks off, not since I programmed in MS Access (am I allowed to say that? Should I even admit where it all started for me back in 1995….), anyway,,, not since I programmed in MSAccess have I really seen a real a tool that really puts the R into RAD when it comes to small system data managment.

So now I want to publish my efforts as I’ve suckered a friend into some peer review, I could publish it to one of my webservers, manually set up a Sql Database etc (don’t have lightswitch deployment support on any of my servers just yet); but this Azure option was just too tempting.

Ok.. it didn’t take 15 minutes (more like 10) but I’ve now got access, hopefully I’ll do a follow up after I publish the final version of my app… stay tuned..
