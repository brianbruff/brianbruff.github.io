To be honest, it’s been a long time since I did any real c++, however I’ve been reading a Java book lately and it’s made me kinda lonesome for C++, the Java book goes into a lot of detail about core language structure, it’s not a book on hibernate, swing etc, just core fundamentals like differences between an internal private class or an internal private interface, static binding of fields etc. I remember when I was at the height of my c++ development career I knew the intricacies about default parameters being statically bound in polymorphic classes, I knew about private inheritance, pitfalls of overriding non virtual functions, thinking back I knew the language quite intimately. Sure in the .net world I know quite a lot of the framework and the libraries toolsets etc (because i’m a greedy little pig and want to know everything) but, I wonder do i know the c# language quite as well as I once knew c++. 

As I said at the outset I’ve been away from c++ for a few years now, I think the last time I did any commercial c++ was in 2006 when I was up to my eyeballs in boost/stl/wtl/atl etc, so what’s changed? Well there’s a new standard for one, **C++11**. Just to keep my finger in I’ve decided to start writing a few little blog posts on the new standard, this is the first one.

In Boost we used to used shared_ptr this class template stored a pointer to a dynamically allocated object, the object pointed to was guaranteed to be deleted when the last shared_ptr pointing to it was destroyed or reset.

e.g.

    #include 

    #include 

    #include 

    #include 

    #include 

    //  The application will produce a series of

    //  objects of type Foo which later must be

    //  accessed both by occurrence (std::vector)

    //  and by ordering relationship (std::set).

    struct Foo

    { 

      Foo( int _x ) : x(_x) {}

      ~Foo() { std::cout << "Destructing a Foo with x=" << x << "\n"; }

      int x;

      /* ... */

    };

    typedef boost::shared_ptr FooPtr;

    struct FooPtrOps

    {

      bool operator()( const FooPtr & a, const FooPtr & b )

        { return a->x > b->x; }

      void operator()( const FooPtr & a )

        { std::cout << a->x << "\n"; }

    };

    int main()

    {

      std::vector         foo_vector;

      std::set  foo_set; // NOT multiset!

      FooPtr foo_ptr( new Foo( 2 ) );

      foo_vector.push_back( foo_ptr );

      foo_set.insert( foo_ptr );

      foo_ptr.reset( new Foo( 1 ) );

      foo_vector.push_back( foo_ptr );

      foo_set.insert( foo_ptr );

      foo_ptr.reset( new Foo( 3 ) );

      foo_vector.push_back( foo_ptr );

      foo_set.insert( foo_ptr );

      foo_ptr.reset ( new Foo( 2 ) );

      foo_vector.push_back( foo_ptr );

      foo_set.insert( foo_ptr );

      std::cout << "foo_vector:\n";

      std::for_each( foo_vector.begin(), foo_vector.end(), FooPtrOps() );

      std::cout << "\nfoo_set:\n"; 

      std::for_each( foo_set.begin(), foo_set.end(), FooPtrOps() );

      std::cout << "\n";

    //  Expected output:

    //

    //   foo_vector:

    //   2

    //   1

    //   3

    //   2

    //   

    //   foo_set:

    //   3

    //   2

    //   1

    //

    //   Destructing a Foo with x=2

    //   Destructing a Foo with x=1

    //   Destructing a Foo with x=3

    //   Destructing a Foo with x=2

      return 0;

    }

In c++ 11 we now get a shared pointer as part of the standard, see my example below.

I know there were some overheads to the boost shared pointer, memory footprint etc, (consider 1x106). of these guys in a container!. But in general shared_ptr can help you, because if you do it manually you’ll likely write slower, buggier code (or both).
