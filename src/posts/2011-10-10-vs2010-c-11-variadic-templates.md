If you’ve been following the changes in the C++11 standard you may have heard of Variadic templates. In layman’s terms: var arg template parameters.

The long and the short of it is, they don’t work yet in vs2010 yet ![Sad smile](./image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png)

I wonder do they work in VS11? I’ll update this post once I get a chance to fire it up. I’ll also fire up my Linux machine and give the GNU compiler a whirl.

Stay tuned…

\*\* update: Doesn’t work in VS11 either.
