# Welcome to My Technical Blog

As a Software Architect, Developer, and Engineer, I've spent years working with various technologies and solving complex problems. This blog will be a platform where I share my experiences, insights, and technical knowledge.

## A Fresh Start

After 16 years of running BlogEngine.NET hosted on Azure, I finally got some time to migrate my blogs to Gatsby. I leveraged GitHub Copilot Studio to convert the old XML BlogEngine files to markdown with embedded data-URL images. It even created the Python migration script for me! This was something I wanted to do for years but never had the energy for it... truly amazing.

This website is now hosted on GitHub Pages for free, and the website is statically generated. The performance improvement is noticeable, and the workflow is much more developer-friendly.

I thought I would miss the convenience of LiveWriter to author my posts, but using Markdown and Git—and even using GitHub Copilot to help author posts for me—is amazing.

## What to Expect

I'll be covering topics including:

- Software Architecture and Design Patterns
- Artificial Intelligence
- Development Best Practices
- Engineering Solutions to Real-world Problems
- Technology Stack Deep Dives


Stay tuned for more technical content!
