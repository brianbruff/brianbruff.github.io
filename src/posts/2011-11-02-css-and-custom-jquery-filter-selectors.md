Iâ€™ve discovered a nice set of jQuery filter selectors.

Take this example of selecting the checked radio button in a group

![](/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_109.png)

### Markup

![](/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_110.png)

### Script

> ![](/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_111.png)

There are many many others, e.g. @contains, :disabled, :not(selector), :parent, :password, etc etc, more info in jQuery docs.
