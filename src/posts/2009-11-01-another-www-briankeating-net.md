Hello and welcome.  
So I've started blogging... lets see how long this lasts

## Why the change?

About 5 months ago I started writing my own Blog engine,

This was a great idea when the only thing (.NET wise) that I wanted to improve upon was my ASP.NET related coding.

My UX background started out with MFC, WTL and then rapidly progressed onto windows forms when I first got my hands on a beta version of .NET 1.0.; however my progress with ASP has been slower than expected as I've never worked for an ASP house, yes I come up with some useful apps that I run on intranets but they are nearly all a labour of love..

As I'm also interested in WPF/Silverlight/WCF/.NET 4.0, basically anything MS related... I find there are not enough hours in the day ..

So what I really needed was a blog engine where I could blog my findings with these new technologies along with other findings .NET related.

Think that's a longwinded way of saying I got lazy and downloaded a ready made solution. BlogEngine.NET.

Don't expect me to offer full blown solutions and projects with each blog item.. Remember "there are not enough hours in the day..."
