I’m passing some parameters to the query ( i know there is mention of a query object in the kendo api but I failed to get this working), in the javascript above I’m just setting these parameters again when the paging happens. Note this was where I could set e.g. $top = options.take; if odata was supported…. <img src=\"./image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-sadsmile_3.png\" alt=\"Sad smile\"></p>\n<p>The next important part is that, I’m getting the result from the .Data field and I’m getting the total form the result.Total field (i also do a bit of mapping for some missing values but that’s application specific).</p>\n<p>kr, Brian.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Kendo Datasource & MVC4 WebApi, you broke my heart","date":"August 31, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2012-08-31-kendo-datasource-mvc4-webapi-you-broke-my-heart/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
