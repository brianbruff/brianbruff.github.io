Consider the following:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_319.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The code above logs <strong>this</strong> three times, but what is <em>this?</em></p>\n<p>The main source of confusion is a quirk of the language where depending on the invocation pattern this can be set to the global variable (e.g. window in a browser). But there are come other gotchas.</p>\n<p>In the example above <strong>this</strong> is 3 different objects.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Window</li>\n<li>ATest</li>\n<li>Object</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Function Invocation Patterns</h2>\n<p>In order to explain this we need to know what function invocation patterns are in JavaScript, of which there are 4.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>method</li>\n<li>function</li>\n<li>constructor</li>\n<li>apply/call</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I’ve covered the first 3 above in my example</p>\n<h3>Method</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_320.png\" alt=\"\"> In the method invocation patters, the method is called bare.
