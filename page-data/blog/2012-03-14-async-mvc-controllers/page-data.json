So, the query will execute on a threadpool thread. To get true asynchronous execution(no worker threads blocked), we need to jump through a few more hoops. For webform people, there’s a very <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163725.aspx\">good explanation here</a>. MVC people read on!</p>\n<h2>But Why/When use async?</h2>\n<p>The response to this question has been discussed many times in both books and magazines. ASP.NET uses threads from a common language runtime (CLR) thread pool to process requests. As long as there are threads available in the thread pool, ASP.NET has no trouble dispatching incoming requests. But once the thread pool becomes saturated-that is, all the threads inside it are busy processing requests and no free threads remain-new requests have to wait for threads to become free. If the jam becomes severe enough and the queue fills to capacity, ASP.NET throws up its hands and responds with a \"Server Unavailable\" to new requests.</p>\n<p>Often to solve the problem of horizontal scalability more servers are added to the webfarm, however this only provided temporary relief to what in fact is an underlying design problem, it’s not a case of adding more processors(threads) but a case of using the threads more efficiently, as you can see from the diagram below, if you are CPU bound, there is little more you can do but add some more servers.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb2_thumb.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>So what is this telling us? Basically, if your app is I/O bound then you should use parallelism, if requests are computationally cheap to process, then parallelism is probably an unnecessary overhead.</p>\n<p>If the incoming request rate is high, then adding more parallelism will likely yield few benefits and could actually decrease performance, since the incoming rate of work may be high enough to keep the CPUs busy.</p>\n<p>If the incoming request rate is low, then the Web application could benefit from parallelism by using the idle CPU cycles to speed up the processing of an individual request. We can use either PLINQ or TPL (either Parallel loops or the Task class) to parallelize the computation over all the processors. Note that by default, however, the PLINQ implementation in .NET 4 will tie-up one ThreadPool worker per processor for the entire execution of the query. As such, it should only be used in Web applications that see few but expensive requests.</p>\n<h2>MVC4</h2>\n<p>In MVC4 it becomes even easier that my previous post on AsyncControllers, actually to me it looks quite like the WinRT async calls in .net 4.5 and C#5</p>\n<h3>Sample using task support for asynchronous controllers</h3>\n<p>You can now write asynchronous action methods as single methods that return an object of type <em>Task</em> or <em>Task</em>.</p>\n<p>e.g.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">public async Task Index(string city)\n\n{    \n\n    var newsService = new NewsService();    \n\n    var sportsService = new SportsService();        \n\n    return View(\"Common\",        \n\n                new PortalViewModel \n\n                {       \n\n                    NewsHeadlines = await newsService.GetHeadlinesAsync(),        \n\n                    SportsScores = await sportsService.GetScoresAsync()    \n\n                });\n\n}</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>In the previous action method, the calls to <em>newsService.GetHeadlinesAsync</em> and <em>sportsService.GetScoresAsync</em> are called asynchronously and do not block a thread from the thread pool.</p>\n<p>Asynchronous action methods that return <em>Task</em> instances can also support timeouts. To make your action method cancellable, add a parameter of type <em>CancellationToken</em> to the action method signature. The following example shows an asynchronous action method that has a timeout of 2500 milliseconds and that displays a <em>TimedOut</em> view to the client if a timeout occurs.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">[AsyncTimeout(2500)] \n\n[HandleError(ExceptionType = typeof(TaskCanceledException), View = \"TimedOut\")]\n\npublic async Task Index(string city, CancellationToken cancellationToken) \n\n{    \n\n    var newsService = new NewsService();    \n\n    var sportsService = new SportsService();       \n\n    return View(\"Common\",        \n\n        new PortalViewModel \n\n        {        \n\n            NewsHeadlines = await newsService.GetHeadlinesAsync(cancellationToken),        \n\n            SportsScores = await sportsService.GetScoresAsync(cancellationToken)    \n\n        });\n\n}</code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<h2>Conculsion</h2>\n<p>MVC4 Makes programming of async controllers even easier.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Async MVC Controllers","date":"March 14, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2012-03-14-async-mvc-controllers/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
