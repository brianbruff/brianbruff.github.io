Would you code your designer code in a windows forms app? not use scaffolding in MVC? etc etc..</p>\n<p>For me Blend is blessing in disguise, I’m not sure the mythical devigner that is both an amazing designer AND an amazing coder (term coined by Scott Hanselman I think) exists, but Blend does really help.</p>\n<h1>Overview</h1>\n<p>The application is simple, It selects some pictures in a folder and displays them in a list. When an item is selected in the list the picture should zoom out from the listbox item and scale to it’s full size.</p>\n<p>Simple ey… yes of course (when you know how).</p>\n<h1>Steps</h1>\n<h3>1. Create a new expression blend silverlight project</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_91.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>2. Add a sample datasource, some text and a picture</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_92.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_93.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_94.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>3. Drag the collection onto the page</h3>\n<h3><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_95.png\" alt=\"\"></h3>\n<h3>4) Select details mode in the properties pane, and drag out property 2</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_96.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_97.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>If you were now to run your application you’d see that when you select a picture it appears in the main picture also. But our requirements were to slide out the picture from the list itself.</p>\n<h3>5) Select the big picture and drag fluid move behaviour onto it</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_98.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>6) Change the tag property to datacontext</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_99.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Now do the same for the Itemtemplate</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_100.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h3>7) Drop a FluidMotionSetTagBehaviour onto the image part,setting the datacontext</h3>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_101.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>That’s all that’s needed, you app should now run, animations and all.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_102.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>I would provide the sample but I’ve used 11megs of pictures so it’s a little too big to expect you to wait for <img src=\"./image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-smile_9.png\" alt=\"Smile\"></p>\n<p>I might get some time to reproduce this app in html5, android, c++, java would be nice to compare and contrast.</p>\n<p>Start blending xamlers!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Silverlight Fluid Motion","date":"September 19, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-09-19-silverlight-fluid-motion/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
