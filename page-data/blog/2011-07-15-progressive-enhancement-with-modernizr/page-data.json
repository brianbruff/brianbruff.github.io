It’s about taking a base application that works on downstream browsers and detecting features and increasing functionality if you have certain features.</p>\n<p>Take example local or session storage, in older versions of browsers there was no local storage so there would be more round tripping.</p>\n<p>So how do we detect these features? One method is a javascript file called Modernizr that detects feature availability (rather than using a database etc).</p>\n<p>Syntax:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre style=\"counter-reset: linenumber NaN\" class=\"language-text line-numbers\"><code class=\"language-text\">   1:  if (Modernizr.localstorage) \n\n   2:  {    \n\n   3:      // browser supports local storage\n\n   4:  }\n\n   5:  else \n\n   6:  {    \n\n   7:      // browser doesn't support local storage\n\n   8:  }\n\n   9:   </code><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"line-numbers-rows\" style=\"white-space: normal; width: auto; left: 0;\"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></pre></div>\n<p>Check out modernizer it's got many detection and abstracts you from detection techniques.</p>\n<p>You’ll get this script added to your project for free in MVC3.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Progressive Enhancement with Modernizr","date":"July 15, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-07-15-progressive-enhancement-with-modernizr/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
