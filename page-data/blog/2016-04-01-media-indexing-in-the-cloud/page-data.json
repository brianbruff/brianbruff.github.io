You can process one media file or multiple media files in a batch. Have a look at this post for some details on how to do it from code <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-index-content/\">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/media-services-index-content/</a></p>\n<p>The code uploads a file then starts an indexing job, then downloads the results:<br>\n<strong>Note:</strong> The source code seen above has a typo, I’ve submitted a pull request to hopefully this will be fixed, but easy to spot.<br>\nAlso the download part failed with an exception for me so i just pulled it down with a little bit of code on a second pass.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_414.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>The above code is possibly all you need if you wish to upload content and start the indexing job manually with the old portal.</p>\n<h4>Here’s how:</h4>\n<p>On your media account upload some content</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_415.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_416.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Once the content is uploaded, start the indexer process, set a good title as Azure will reach out to the interweb and use it to seed the language extraction.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_417.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_418.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>There is no way to download the output from the portal so use use the code i shared above to download the content.</p>\n<p>I processed the latest podcast at time of publishing from <a href=\"https://www.dotnetrocks.com/\">https://www.dotnetrocks.com/</a><br>\n<a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_1276_news_from_build.mp3\">https://s3.amazonaws.com/dnr/dotnetrocks_1276_news_from_build.mp3</a></p>\n<p>In hindsight it was possibly not the best podcast to index as it was recorded live @build (i expect, i’m two episodes behind on DNR this week so have not listened to it yet), the DNR guys typically have exceedingly good audio, at some stage it might be worth indexing another episode.</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<p>You can find the results here <a href=\"/data/dotnetrocks_1276_news_from_build.zip\">here</a> , initially my knee jerk reaction was , “ah this is poor” but after reflecting on it I’m blown away by what was done and so so, sooo easily!</p>\n<p>With a bit of editing this can be thrown into Azure Search / Sql Server etc for full text search and direct seek media playback.</p>\n<p>See for yourself:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_419.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For sure it needs some editing, e.g.<br>\nI release the eleventh music decode by<br>\nshould in-fact be<br>\nI released the eleventh music to code by</p>\n<p>but what a great start!!!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Media Indexing In the Cloud","date":"April 01, 2016"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2016-04-01-media-indexing-in-the-cloud/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
