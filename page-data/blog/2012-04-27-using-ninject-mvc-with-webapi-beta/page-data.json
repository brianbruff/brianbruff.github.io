I started working on a work related REST API, and iPad client</p>\n<p>The Rest API will eventually sit in a Java Application server (JBoss/Wls etc). However even though I’ve done my fair share of java programming in recent years I’m not sure where to start when it comes to writing a REST API and what framework to use (JSF/Spring MVC ? etc).</p>\n<h2>Learning curve</h2>\n<p>As indicated, the other side of the story is that the first client I’ll be writing is for an iPad…. now while I’ve played with iOS i’ve never developed an app and i think now is time to start. I’ve read some books on Objective-C and casually glanced as some ios apps that a friend of mine @tomsamcguinness has developed on joint ventures. So this puts me realistically at the bottom of yet another learning curve.</p>\n<p>Given this iOS learning curve is more important to me I’ve decided the the first REST API I will write will be in ASP MVC Api, using this technology will allow me to quickly implement the server side and allow me to focus on the iOS client. Once the interface is formulized</p>\n<h2>Wcf</h2>\n<p>The Mvc application will communicated with the existing java application servers via WCF, if you’ve familiar with WCF you’ll under stand the the ‘C’ in the ABC stands for contract.</p>\n<p>SOILD</p>\n<p>IOC</p>\n<p>DI</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using NinJect MVC with WebApi Beta","date":"April 27, 2012"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2012-04-27-using-ninject-mvc-with-webapi-beta/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
