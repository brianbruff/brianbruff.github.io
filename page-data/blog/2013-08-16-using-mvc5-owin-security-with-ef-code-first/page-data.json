Tonight I had some free time and like a dog with a bone I wanted to figure this out. I’m not saying I came up with the nicest or correct solution, but alas I came up with something that appears to be working for me.<br>\nPlease feel free to give me any feedback I’d appreciate it.</p>\n<h2>The problem</h2>\n<p>I wanted one single database containing my own entities and also the security entities.<br>\nI wanted to use the latest MVC5 built on the <a href=\"http://owin.org/\">OWIN</a> (open web interface for .net).<br>\nI wanted to use code first migrations to keep my database up to date.<br>\nI could find no documentation..</p>\n<h2>The Solution</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Create my own entity class</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_271.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create my own DBContext and IdentityStoreContext (the secret sauce)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_272.png\" alt=\"\"> The SiteCertDbContext derives from the IdentityDbContext used by default in MVC5 Update1.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the account controller use this new DbContext</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_273.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That’s pretty much it, hope it helps someone else out you can now open the Nuget package manager and Enable-Migrations.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using MVC5 Owin Security with EF Code First","date":"August 16, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-08-16-using-mvc5-owin-security-with-ef-code-first/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
