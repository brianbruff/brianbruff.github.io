I like this approach especially as it will easily allow me to support other clients I/others may write in future, in so far as, it returns Json and is a RestAPI.</p>\n<p>Now I’ve never used DataTables before so I’m trialling it as my client side html grid. However I quickly ran into problems with it and the expected Json Payload.</p>\n<p>If you are familiar with the various .net Json serializers you’ll get some Json back with Key value pairs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/./image.axd?picture=image_thumb_193.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>e.g. {[“Name” : “Brian”, “Age” : “35”], [“Name” : “Brian1”, “Age” : “36”]}</p>\n<p>This causes a major problem for DataTables in that it expects (<em>by default</em>)</p>\n<p>e.g. {“Brian”, “35”], [“Brian1”,“36”]}</p>\n<p>I say by default because maybe there is a way to configure this out of the box with column mappings and what not, however I can’t see the wood for the trees so my first approach will be to perform this data mapping myself, I’ll RTFM at a later date <img src=\"./image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-smile_15.png\" alt=\"Smile\"></p>\n<p>So where can I plug into the pipeline and map this data? fnServerData !
