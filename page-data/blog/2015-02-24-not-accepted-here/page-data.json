The screenshot below shows the changes, I’m now returning a TimeSheetDto list (previously just a TimeSheet list) and I’m just projecting <em>(using automapper)</em> the Timesheets from my database into these DTO’s .</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images//images/image_thumb_363.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>However when I test said entities I see nothing come back in my browser, nada,zilch,zippo… so what is happening?<br>\nWell I fired up fiddler and saw that I was getting a HTTP status code of 406, but why?<br>\nIt worked before and I changed nothing…. oh wait!….</p>\n<p>Configure OData entities</p>\n<p>You know that message that gets scaffolded with new OData end points!?
