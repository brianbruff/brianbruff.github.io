It was remarkable how quickly AI could interpret my requirements and translate them into a variety of design options. This saved hours, if not days, of manual prototyping and allowed me to rapidly iterate on the visual direction of the app.</p>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01d832d1-387a-4541-ae59-eb2888f4f6cb\" alt=\"image1\">\n<h2>AI-Generated Icon</h2>\n<p>The app's icon was also generated by AI. Rather than spending time on manual graphic design, I relied on generative tools to create a clean, memorable icon that matches the application's personality.</p>\n<h2>Issue Creation with GitHub Copilot</h2>\n<p>For tracking work, I used GitHub Copilot to help draft project issues. Copilot's context awareness made it easy to break down features and tasks, ensuring nothing was missed in my planning.</p>\n<h2>Implementation with Code Agents</h2>\n<p>Most of the coding was handled by GitHub code agents, with some features implemented using GitHub Copilot Agent in VSCode. This collaborative approach let me focus on orchestrating the process: guiding the AI, reviewing suggestions, and making high-level decisions, rather than getting bogged down in every detail myself.</p>\n<h2>Timeline and Role</h2>\n<p>Amazingly, the whole project took just three evenings to complete. My main role was to coordinate the AIs, acting as a conductor rather than a solo performer. Instead of solving every problem myself, I let the AI tools do the heavy lifting and concentrated my effort on direction and quality control.</p>\n<h2>Results and Reflections</h2>\n<p>The end result was an application that was not only built faster but was also better tested, better documented, and more robust than what I could have achieved solo. I like to think this process puts me at the cutting edge (sometimes even the bleeding edge!) of modern development practices – though I say this with humility and a sense of excitement for what's possible, not self-importance.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This experience reinforced to me that AI isn't just automating code, it's empowering developers to build better software, faster – and making the process a lot more fun along the way.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Using AI to Develop Applications End-to-End – A PileupBuster Showcase","date":"June 15, 2025"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2024-01-15-using-ai-to-develop-applications-end-to-end-a-pileupbuster-showcase/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
