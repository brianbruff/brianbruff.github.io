As it turns out this podcast did a review on NDepends <a href=\"http://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/ndepend-on-how-good-your-code-is/\">http://www.codingblocks.net/podcast/ndepend-on-how-good-your-code-is/</a> and I encourage you to check it out. Moreover; in a more recent episode they mention that they’ve received feedback from Patrick Smacchia (Lead Developer and brains behind the tool) and the feedback they’ve received from Patrick on the few little niggles they encountered is quite positive and upbeat.</p>\n<p>When I find myself looking for some tooling like this I’ll write a proper review of my own, but until then based on my interactions with Patrick and after listening to the podcast above, I encourage you, that if you’re in the market for such analysis tools to take <a href=\"http://www.ndepend.com/\"><strong>NDepends</strong></a> for a spin, and let us know how you get on!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"NDepend","date":"October 13, 2014"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2014-10-13-ndepend/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
