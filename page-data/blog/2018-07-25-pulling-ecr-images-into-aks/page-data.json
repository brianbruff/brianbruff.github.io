If my k8s cluster was in AWS it would be transparent to me provided the IAM user had permission but, in order to pull such an image from Azure; one can create a secret and to pull the image, sadly (or maybe thankfully) this secret expires after 12 hours so we need to keep refreshing.</p>\n<p>Below I present an approach which could be used, it creates a service account (note I apply the permissions to the default account also as some of my deployments dont reference this service account yet) for pulling the image with RBAC, permissions, there is a kubernetes job that will execute immediately and a cronjob that will execute every 8 hours thereafter</p>\n<p>Just use this secret in your deployments</p>\n<p>spec:</p>\n<p>imagePullSecrets:</p>\n<p>- name: dg-ecr-pull</p>\n<p>Hope this is of benefit to others! remember to update those  sections!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Pulling ECR images into AKS","date":"July 25, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2018-07-25-pulling-ecr-images-into-aks/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
