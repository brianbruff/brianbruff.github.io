If when an Android version is done it will be in Java because I’ve programmed in Java for years too (hey I’m looking for an excuse (and the time) to try this new Android Studio).<br>\nGiven a different use case I we may well have an even more compelling reason for using C# for both platforms with something like MVVM Cross and achieve a more DRY approach.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Xamarin a few weeks on","date":"June 13, 2013"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2013-06-13-xamarin-a-few-weeks-on/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
