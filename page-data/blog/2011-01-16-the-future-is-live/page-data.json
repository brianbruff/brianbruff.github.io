There in lies the problem, is it worth the overhead of manually having to synchronize all these pcs?</p>\n<p>Sure source code is and always has been handled by a source control repository, tfs/svn etc.</p>\n<p>But what about documents; during the week I started setting up a new desktop machine, tonight while working on a java project (i know i know) i found that i needed to copy a few strings into the clipboard as I was developing, now I usually do this from within vs2010 but I’m not sure how to do this from the Java Netbeans IDE so i though I’d use MS Onenote.. there in lied the problem. I wanted to access the notebook I had on my laptop but I didn’t want to start an import/export process (so 90ies <img src=\"/blog/image.axd?picture=wlEmoticon-rollingonthefloorlaughing.png\" alt=\"Rolling on the floor laughing\">).</p>\n<p>Turns out that onenote 2010 allows me to save my notebook on a network share (not so exciting because i could do this with UNC paths); but moreover it allows you to keep your notebook synchronized with windows live office space.</p>\n<p>So now I‘ve got my notebooks sitting in the cloud and cached and accessed locally on different computers. Now I’ve not really invested much if any time in could services, but I think it’s time to start, I’ve a sneaky suspicion that going forward operating systems will become more and more cloud integrated. I can’t see anyone choosing to manually upload and download documents to servers when this can now easily be managed by hitting that save button.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The future is live","date":"January 16, 2011"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/2011-01-16-the-future-is-live/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2326376460","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
