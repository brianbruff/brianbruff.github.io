  <title>C# 4.0 Dynamic Keyword</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;"object x" is a shorthand for "System.Object x". &lt;br /&gt;This declares the variable x to have the type System.Object, this is strongly typed.&lt;br /&gt; And since C# provides autoboxing, you can assign anything you want to this variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"var x = E" declares a variable x to be of the type of the expression E. &lt;br /&gt;The E is required, not optional. This is a strongly typed declaration, and you can only assign values whose type is typeof(E) to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"dynamic x" declares the variable x to have dynamic semantics. &lt;br /&gt;This means that the C# compiler will generate code that will allow dynamic invocations on x.&lt;br /&gt; The actual meaning of "x.M" is deferred until runtime and will depend on the semantics of the IDynamicObject implementation&lt;/p&gt;</content>
