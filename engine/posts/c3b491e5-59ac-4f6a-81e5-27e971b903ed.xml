  <content>&lt;p&gt;Hello and welcome.   &lt;br /&gt;So I've started blogging... lets see how long this lasts&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Why the change?&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;About 5 months ago I started writing my own Blog engine,&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This was a great idea when the only thing (.NET wise) that I wanted to improve upon was my ASP.NET related coding.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;My UX background started out with MFC, WTL and then rapidly progressed onto windows forms when I first got my hands on a beta version of .NET 1.0.; however my progress with ASP has been slower than expected as I've never worked for an ASP house, yes I come up with some useful apps that I run on intranets but they are nearly all a labour of love..&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I'm also interested in WPF/Silverlight/WCF/.NET 4.0, basically anything MS related... I find there are not enough hours in the day .. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;So what I really needed was a blog engine where I could blog my findings with these new technologies along with other findings .NET related. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Think that's a longwinded way of saying I got lazy and downloaded a ready made solution.&amp;#160; BlogEngine.NET.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Don't expect me to offer full blown solutions and projects with each blog item.. Remember &amp;quot;there are not enough hours in the day...&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;</content>
