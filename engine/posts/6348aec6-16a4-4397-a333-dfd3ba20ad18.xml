  <content>&lt;p&gt;Tonight I've stumbled across an interesting Blog on cimgf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cimgf.com/2010/02/12/accessing-the-cloud-from-cocoa-touch/#more-909"&gt;http://www.cimgf.com/2010/02/12/accessing-the-cloud-from-cocoa-touch/#more-909&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's been many years since I wrote PHP, so I'd naturally use asp.net serverside&amp;nbsp;(or if i had a pc powerfull enough I'd use the new REST capabilities of Sharepoint 2010 server).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been dying to have a play with Azures for sometime now but I'm always either snowed under with work or playing with some other technology, I remember reading that Azures (storage at least) has a REST API, and with the&amp;nbsp;launch of the iPhone on the Vodafone network at the end of this month I've been looking into what's involved in writing objective C (and some mono stuff) so it seems I may finally get to have a play :-)&lt;/p&gt;
