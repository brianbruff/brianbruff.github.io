  <title>Serverless on my server</title>
  <description />
  <content>&lt;p&gt;So I’ve been looking for a serverless framework that can run on-prem and in 
the cloud, I’ve been leaning towards OpenFaaS as it appears to be gaining more 
traction, however I love Azure functions and though let’s see if this is a 
viable solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I download what is a Preview, so I wasn’t expecting miracles, I’m sharing the 
reasons why I can’t use it for my own requirements below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It might save some of you guys the effort, I must reiterate that this is 
still a preview so some of the stuff I say here will be out of date really 
quickly!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have decided against Azure Function On Prem in March 2017 
because&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs Sql Server, I can’t rely on having this at least not for some brown 
field projects I want to use serverless for.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It needs IIS, I have to run on Linux (might be a solved problem… especially 
as it’s using the new .net core runtime&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It only has Javascript and C# language support in preview, I need Java, and 
Go and Phython would be nice to haves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The packaging was a windows installer, I was hoping for some docker images, 
I expect this is a solved solution and for now the MSI is a quick win for the 
developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next it’s down the rabbits burrow with OpenFaas on Kubernetes, cross your 
fingers for me!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
